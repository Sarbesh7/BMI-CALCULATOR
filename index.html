                <p>Charts are another easy way to find your BMI. To use the table below, find your height on the left side of the chart, then go across to the weight that is closest to yours. At the top of the chart you can see your BMI, and at the bottom of the chart you can see which category you fit into healthy weight, overweight, or obese:</p>

          <summary>Healthy BMI</summary>
          <div class="hh">
              <p>
                A healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) generally falls within the range of 18.5 to 24.9. Here's a breakdown of BMI categories:
              </p>
              <p>
                <li><b>Underweight:</b>BMI less than 18.5</li><br>
                <li><b>Normalweight:</b>BMI 18.5 to 24.9</li><br>
                <li><b>Overweight:</b>BMI 25 to 29.9</li><br>
                <li><b>Obesity:</b>BMI 30 or higher</li><br>
              </p>
              <p>It’s important to note that BMI doesn’t account for muscle mass, bone density, or other factors, so it’s just one of several tools used to assess overall health.</p>

            <summary>BMI Formula</summary>
            <div class="hh">
                <p>You can also calculate your own BMI. The actual formula to determine BMI uses metric system measurements: weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters, squared (m2).<br>
<BR></BR>
                  When using pounds and inches, the formula needs to be altered slightly. Multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Divide that by your height in inches, squared:<br>
                  <BR></BR>
                  BMI = (your weight in pounds x 703) ÷ (your height in inches x your height in inches)  <br>
                  <BR></BR>
                  For example, if you weigh 120 pounds and are 5 ft. 3 in. (63 in.) tall:  <br>
                  <BR></BR>
                  BMI = (120 x 703) ÷ (63 x 63) or 84,360 ÷ 3969 = 21.3
                  <BR>    <BR>
                  This is well within the healthy weight range.</p>

          <summary>Finding BMI in children and teens</summary>
          <div class="hh">
              <p>BMI can be calculated the same way for children and teens as it is for adults, but the numbers don’t have the same meaning. This is because the normal amount of body fat changes with age in children and teens, and is different between boys and girls. So for kids, BMI levels that define being normal weight or overweight are based on the child’s age and sex.

              </p>


              <p>
                To account for this, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed age- and sex-specific growth charts. These charts are used to translate a BMI number into a percentile based on a child’s sex and age. The percentiles are then used to determine the different weight groups:

                </p>
                <p>
                  <li><b>Underweight:</b> less than the 5th percentile</li><br>
                  <li><b>Normal weight:</b>5th percentile to less than the 85th percentile</li><br>
                  <li><b>Overweight</b>85th percentile to less than the 95th percentile</li><br>
                  <li><b>Obese: </b> 95th percentile or higher</li>
